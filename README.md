##Formats

###Files

In data folder you will find yml files. The format is DATA_TYPE.LANG.yml.

* DATA_TYPE : traits, skills etc ...
* LANG : two letters like en, fr, es ...

###Yml format

Open one of the present file, for instance skills.en.yml
You will see that all file have the following hierachi :

````.yml
en:
  key_name:
    data1: value
    data2: value ...
````

The key_name is used as a unique item id.
It means couple of things :
* Never correct it even if it contain a typo. It's not used for display.
* If you translate content, you have to keep the same key_name to allow the system to understand that it's the same resource.

## Usage

You can use it or as a standalone or as a ruby gem.
There is a Licence section below, check it if you care about legal issues.

### Standalone Data

Just include eclipse_spot_data folder or yml file in your project and, well, it's yml so parse it yourself.

### As a ruby gem

If you are using ruby, then you can use eclipse_spot_data as a gem.
Optionaly you can provide a version if you want to prevent data update.

#### Not rails

Simply install the gem :

````.ruby
gem install git@github.com:proxygear/eclipse_spot_data.git

gem update git@github.com:proxygear/eclipse_spot_data.git
````

#### Really rails

If you are using Rails, then add in you gem file :

````.ruby
gem 'eclipse_spot_data', git: 'git@github.com:proxygear/eclipse_spot_data.git'
````

Then bundle it in your shell

````
$> bundle

$> bundle update eclipse_spot_data
````

#### Any way the code ?

Well easy, just an interface to load data type by language

````.ruby
  EclipseSpot::Data.get :traits, :en
  #=> a big hash
````
