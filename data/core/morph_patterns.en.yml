    flexbots:
      name: Flexbot
      description: "Designed for multi-purpose functions, flexbots can transform their shells to suit a range of situations and tasks. Their core frame consists of a half-dozen interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multi- legged walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others. Each module features its own sensor units and “bush robot” fractal-branching digits (each capable of break- ing into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbot control computer is also distributed between modules. Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics as- sembly, and so on."

    reaper:
      name: Reaper
      morph_type: synthetic
      description: "The reaper is a common combat bot, used in place of biomorph soldiers and typically operated via teleop- eration or by autonomous AI. The reaper’s core form is an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. It uses vector thrust nozzles to maneuver in microgravity, and also takes advan- tage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance. Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. The reaper’s shell is made of smart materials, allowing these limbs and weapon mounts to extrude in any direction desired and even to change shape and length. In gravity environments, the reaper walks or hops on two or four of these limbs. Reapers are infamous due to numerous war XPs, and bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows, if not get you arrested."

Snake bots can coil, twist, and roll their bodies into a ball or hoop, moving either by slithering, burrowing, rolling, or pulling themselves along by their arms. The sensor suite and control com- puter are housed in the head."

    swarmoid:

      morph_type: synthetic
      description: "The swarmanoid is not a single shell per se, but rather a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic micro- drones. Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The controlling computer and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a unit. Individual bugs are quite capable of interfacing with electronics."
