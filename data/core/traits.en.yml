For example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the character’s relationship is with this group, and why the character can call on them for aid. Gamemaster’s should take care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more than once per game session. The character’s ties to this group are also a two-way street—they will be expected to perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for scenarios)."

    description: "The character has an influential person in their life who can be relied on for occasional support. This could be a wealthy hyperelite family member, a high-ranking triad boss, or an anarchist networker with an unbeatable reputation. When called upon, this patron can pull strings on the character’s behalf, supply resources, introduce them to people they need to know, and bail them out of trouble. The player and gamemaster should work together to define exactly who this NPC is and what their relationship with the player character is. Specifically, the question of why this patron is supporting the character should be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies? the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters should be careful that this trait does not get abused. The patron should be an occasional help (probably no more than once per game session at most) but is not always at the character’s beck-and-call. If the character asks for too much, too often, they should find the patron’s support drying up. Additionally, the character may need to take action to maintain the relationship, such as undertaking a mission on the patron’s behalf. In fact, the character may only have their patronage because they are on-call or of use to the NPC in some way."

This morph, however, possesses a physical look that can only be described as striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and fascinating—even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati take notice. On social skill tests where the character’s beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +10 (for Level 1) or +20 (for Level 2) modifier. This modifier is ineffective against xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds. This trait is only available to biomorphs. This modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs, but at half the cost, and it is only effective against characters with that specific uplift background (i.e., neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.).

The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character’s physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Minor: A minor addiction is largely kept under control—it does not ruin the character’s life, though it may create some difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have a problem. The character must indulge the addiction at least once a week, though they can go for longer without too much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose, they suffer a –10 modifier on all actions until they get their fix. Moderate: A moderate addiction is in full swing. The character obviously has a problem, and must satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they fail to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive behavior, physical sickness, or other side effects until they indulge their craving. Apply a –20 modifier to all of the character’s actions until they get their fix. Additionally, a character with this level of addiction suffers a –5 DUR penalty. Major: A character with a major addiction is on the rapid road to ruin. They face cravings every 6 hours, and suffer a –10 DUR penalty as their health is affected. If they fail to get their regular dosage, they suffer a –30 modifier on all actions until they do. If their life hasn’t already been ruined by their obsession, it soon will be."

The gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal to the character’s Moxie stat, which also refreshes at the same rate as the character’s Moxie. Only the gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and the purpose is to use it against the character. In other words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that fol- lows the character, the gamemaster can even use this bad Moxie against the character’s friends and allies, when they are doing something with or related to the character, though this should be used sparingly.

This lack of common sense may lead the character to misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret someone’s body language. Once per game session, the gamemaster may in- tentionally mislead the character when giving them a description about some thing or some social in- teraction.

This trait should only be available to characters with the infolife or reinstantiated backgrounds, though the gamemaster may allow it for characters who have extensive virtual reality/XP use in their personal histories."
  severe_allergy:
    name: Severe allergy
    positive: false
    target: morph
    cp_cost: "-10, -20"
    description: "The morph’s biochemistry suffers a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) when it comes into contact (touched, inhaled, or ingested) with a specific allergen. The allergen may be common (dust, dander, plant pollen, certain foods, latex) or uncommon (certain drugs, insect stings). The player and gamemaster should agree on an allergen that fits the game. If exposed to the allergen, the character breaks into hives, has difficulty to breath- ing (–30 modifier to all actions), and must make a DUR Test or go into anaphylactic shock (dying of respiratory failure in 2d10 minutes unless medical care is applied). This trait is only available to biomorphs."
  slow_learner:
    name: Slow learner
    positive: false
    cp_cost: "-10"
    description: "New skills are not easy for this character to pick up. The character takes twice as long as normal to improve skills or learn new ones (p. 152)."
  social_stigma:
    name: Social stigma
    target: both
    positive: false
    cp_cost: -10
    description: "An unfortunate aspect of the character’s background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. They may be sleeved in a morph viewed with repugnance, be a survivor of the infamous Lost generation, or may be an AGI in a post-Fall society plagued by fear of artificial intelli- gence. In social situations where the character’s nature is known to someone who view that nature with dis- taste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a –10 to –30 modifier (gamemaster’s discretion) to social skill tests."
  timid:
    name: Timid
    positive: false
    cp_cost: -10
    description: "his character frightens easily. They suffer a –10 modifier when resisting fear or intimidation."
  unattractive:
    target: morph
    name: Unattractive
    positive: false
    description: "In a time when good looks are easily purchased, this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness is increasingly associated with being poor, backward, or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good looks range from distaste to horror. The character suf- fers a –10 modifier on social tests for Level 1, –20 for Level 2, and –30 for Level 3. Only biomorphs may take this trait. This modififier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds. This modififier may be purchased for uplift morphs, but at half the bonus, and it is only effective against char- acters with that specifific uplift background (i.e., neo- avians, neo-hominids, etc.)."
    cp_cost: "-10, -20, -30"
  uncanny_valley:
    name: Unncanny valley
    target: morph
    positive: false
    description: "There is a point where synthetic human looks become uncannily realistic and human-seeming, but they remain just different enough that their looks seem creepy or even repulsive—a phenomenon called the “uncanny valley.” Morphs whose looks fall into this range suffer a –10 modifier on social skill tests when dealing with humans. This modifier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds."
    cp_cost: -10
  unfit:
    name: Unfit
    positive: false
    target: morph
    cp_cost: "-10, -20"
    description: "The morph is either not optimized for health and/or just in bad shape. Reduce the aptitude maximums for Coordination, Reflexes, and Somatics by 5 (Level 1 ) or 10 (Level 2)."
  vr_vertigo:
    positive: false
    name: VR Vertigo
    cp_cost: "-10"
    description: "The character experiences intense vertigo and nausea when interfacing with any type of virtual real- ity, XP, or simulspace. Augmented reality has no effect, but VR inflicts a –30 modifier to all of the character’s actions. Prolonged use of VR (gamemaster’s discre- tion) may actually incapacitate the character should they fail a WIL x 2 Test."
  weak_immune_system:
    positive: false
    target: morph
    name: Weak immune system
    cp_cost: "-10, -20" 
    description: "he morph’s immune system is susceptible to diseases, drugs, and toxins. At Level 1, apply a –10 modifier whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects of a toxin or drug. At Level 2, increase this modifier to –20. This trait is only available to biomorphs."
  zero_g_nausea:
    positive: false
    target: morph
    name: Zero-G nausea
    cp_cost: -10
    description: "This morph suffers from space sickness and does not fair well in zero-gravity. The character suffers a –10 modifier in any microgravity climate. Addition- ally, whenever the character is first getting acclimated or anytime they must endure excessive movement in microgravity, they must make a WIL Test or spend 1 hour incapacitated by nausea per 10 points of MoF."
