    anarchist:
      name: Anarchist
      description: "You are opposed to hierarchy, favoring flat forms of social organization and directly democratic decision- making. You believe power is always corrupting and everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. According to the primitive and restrictive policies of the Inner system and Jovian Junta, this makes you an irresponsible hoodlum at best and a ter- rorist at worst. In your opinion, that’s comedy coming from governments that keep their populations in line with economic oppression and threats of violence."

    brinker:
      name: Brinker
      description: "You or your faction is reluctant to deal with the rest of the transhumanity and the various goings-on in the rest of the system. Your particular grouping may have sought out self- imposed isolation, to pursue their own interests, or they may have been exiled for their unpopular beliefs.

You might be a religious cultist, a primitivist, a utopian, or something altogether uninterested in transhumanity."

    extropian:
      name: Extropian
      description: "You are an anarchistic supporter of the free market and pri- vate property. You oppose government and favor a system where security and legal matters are handled by private com- petitors.

A paradigm shift has oc- curred, and while everyone else is catching up, your faction embraces and revels in it. There is no more want, no more death, no more limits on what you can be. The scum have immersed themselves in a new way of life, changing themselves as they see fit, trying out new experiences, and pushing the boundaries wherever they can ... and fuck anyone who can’t deal with that."
